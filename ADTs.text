We know that programming language have built-in data type such as => int , float , char etc . In which we can perform the operations like => addition , substraction , multiplication etc . But there might be a situation in which we want to perform the operations for our user defined data types which we have to defined . To resolve this problem , we create data structures along with some basic operations and data structures which are not built-in are known as abstract data type.

Abstract data type is a type (or a class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of values and a set of operations.The definition of ADT only mentions that what operations are to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.

The process of only providing the essentials and hiding the details is known as abstraction
